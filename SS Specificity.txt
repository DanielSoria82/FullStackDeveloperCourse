What Is the Universal Selector, and What Is Its Specificity?
The universal selector (*) is a special type of CSS selector that matches any element in the document.
It is often used to apply a style to all elements on the page, which can be useful for resetting or normalizing styles across different browsers.
The universal selector can be used to select all elements within a specific context or globally across the entire document.
<head>
  <style>
    * {
      color: blue;
    }
    p {
      color: red;
    }
    .highlight {
      color: green;
    }
    #unique {
      color: purple;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="unique" class="highlight">This text has multiple styles applied.</p>
</body>
The universal selector has the lowest specificity value of any selector. It contributes 0 to all parts of the specificity value (0, 0, 0, 0). This means that any other selector, including type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and inline styles, will override the styles set by the universal selector.

What Is the Specificity for Type Selectors?
Type selectors -also known as "element selectors"- are straightforward to use and are written simply as the tag name of the element you want to style. Type selectors have a relatively low specificity compared to other selectors. The specificity value for a type selector is (0, 0, 0, 1). This means that type selectors will be overridden by class selectors, ID selectors, and inline styles, but can still apply styles unless those higher-specificity rules are present.

Class selectors allows developers to target multiple elements with the same class attribute and apply consistent styling. Class selectors are defined by a period (.) followed by the class name. They can be applied to any element in the HTML document. Class selectors have a higher specificity than type selectors but lower than ID selectors and inline styles. The specificity value for a class selector is (0, 0, 1, 0). This means that class selectors can override type selectors, but they can be overridden by ID selectors and inline styles. Class selectors can be combined with other selectors to create more specific rules.

What Is the Specificity for ID Selectors?
ID selectors are allows developers to apply styles to specific elements with unique identifiers. ID selectors are defined by a hash symbol (#) followed by the ID name. They should be unique within an HTML document, meaning no two elements should share the same ID. ID selectors have a very high specificity, higher than type selectors and class selectors, but lower than inline styles. The specificity value for an ID selector is (0, 1, 0, 0). This means that ID selectors can override class selectors and type selectors but can be overridden by inline styles.
