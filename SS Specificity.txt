What Is the Universal Selector, and What Is Its Specificity?
The universal selector (*) is a special type of CSS selector that matches any element in the document.
It is often used to apply a style to all elements on the page, which can be useful for resetting or normalizing styles across different browsers.
The universal selector can be used to select all elements within a specific context or globally across the entire document.
<head>
  <style>
    * {
      color: blue;
    }
    p {
      color: red;
    }
    .highlight {
      color: green;
    }
    #unique {
      color: purple;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p id="unique" class="highlight">This text has multiple styles applied.</p>
</body>
The universal selector has the lowest specificity value of any selector. It contributes 0 to all parts of the specificity value (0, 0, 0, 0). This means that any other selector, including type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and inline styles, will override the styles set by the universal selector.
