        <li>Peel and cut: Peel the potatoes (optional) and cut them into thin, even strips.</li>

        <li>First fry: Fry the potatoes in batches for about 3-4 minutes, until soft but not golden. Remove and drain on
            paper towels</li>
        <li>Increase the heat: Raise the oil temperature to 190째C (375째F).</li>
        <li>Second fry: Fry the potatoes again for 2-3 minutes, until golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain and season: Remove from the oil, drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt (or your favorite
