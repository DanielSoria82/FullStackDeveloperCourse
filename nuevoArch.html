    <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
        <p>Build your projects. Show them to your friends. Build projects for your friends.</p>
        <p>Build your network. Help the people you meet along the way. What goes around comes around. You'll get what's
            coming to you.</p>
        <p>It is not too late. Life is long.</p>
        <p>You will look back on this moment years from now and be glad you made a move.</p>
